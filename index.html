      <h1>Privacy Policy for Bible</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 16, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Bible (the “App”) handles information
        when you use it. The App is designed to work offline and does not use
        advertising.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App does not require an account.</li>
        <li>The App does not collect or sell personal information.</li>
        <li>
          Bible text and images are bundled locally and not downloaded from the
          internet.
        </li>
        <li>Your bookmarks and preferences are stored only on your device.</li>
        <li>
          The only time information may leave the App is when you choose to
          share verses/images using your device’s share options.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>2.1 Personal information</h3>
      <p>
        The App does not ask for or collect personal information such as your
        name, email, phone number, precise location, or contacts.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 App data stored on your device (local-only)</h3>
      <p>
        To provide core features, the App stores some data locally on your
        device, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bookmarks (saved verses)</li>
        <li>Reading/navigation state (e.g., the last opened book/chapter)</li>
        <li>Preferences/settings (e.g., onboarding completion)</li>
        <li>
          Cached content used inside the App (e.g., daily verse caching and
          tutorial state)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data stays on your device and is not automatically transmitted to
        us.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Automatically collected data</h3>
      <p>
        The App does not intentionally collect analytics data. However, your app
        store, operating system, or device manufacturer may collect certain
        diagnostics or crash information according to their own policies.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Internet Use</h2>
      <p>The App’s content is provided offline:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bible text is locally sourced (bundled with the App).</li>
        <li>Images are locally sourced (bundled with the App).</li>
        <li>
          The App does not download Bible content or images from the internet
          for normal operation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Sharing</h2>
      <p>The App includes optional sharing features. If you choose to share:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The App may share verse text or an image you generate (e.g., a verse
          card screenshot) using your device’s system share sheet.
        </li>
        <li>You control what is shared and which app/service receives it.</li>
        <li>
          We do not receive the content you share. The recipient app/service
          handles it under their own privacy policy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Advertising and Tracking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App does not display ads.</li>
        <li>The App does not use third‑party advertising SDKs.</li>
        <li>The App does not track you across apps or websites.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Because your data is stored locally:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bookmarks and preferences remain on your device until you remove them
          in the App or uninstall the App.
        </li>
        <li>Uninstalling the App typically removes locally stored app data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7) Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect information stored within the
        App. However, no method of storage is 100% secure. You are responsible
        for keeping your device secure.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided
        personal information through the App, contact us and we will address it.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the
        “Effective date” and publish the revised policy.
      </p>
