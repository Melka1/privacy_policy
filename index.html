    <h1>Privacy Policy for Lideta Mekaneyesus Church app</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 11, 2025</p>

    <p>Lideta Mekaneyesus Church app ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our mobile application to stream church sermons, music, and related content. Our app does <strong>not require account creation</strong> and can be used without submitting any personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or login credentials. You can use Lideta Mekaneyesus Church app freely without creating an account.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We May Collect</h2>
    <p>While we do not collect personal information, we may gather limited, non-identifiable usage data to improve the app. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
      <li>Anonymous usage statistics (e.g., features accessed, crash reports)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected in aggregate and does not personally identify you.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app may request access to certain features on your device (such as storage or network access) solely to support core functionality. We do not use these permissions to collect personal data.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party tools like analytics providers to help us understand app usage and improve performance. These services collect only anonymized, non-identifiable information in accordance with their respective privacy policies. We recommend reviewing any third-party services linked in the app for more details.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure the app is secure and that any non-personal data collected is protected from unauthorized access or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute safety of your data.</p>
